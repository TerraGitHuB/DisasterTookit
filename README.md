Hi! Welcome to my project SchoolDisasterToolkit.

As the name suggests, this toolkit is designed for exploiting school systems to make your life that little bit easier.

From generating master passwords for several different machines from several different manufacturers, to detecting and shrinking partitions on school computers to allow space for running your own OS's on it, if you want to make using a school computer less of a slog, this is THE project. 

It aims to be a compilation of different algorithms and such like. Some built by me, others by other people which I have ported over for proper intergration. 

It also aims to be cross platform to target as many systems as possible, although it's really built windows school systems in mind.

Also, despite the name, I DO NOT condone using anything in this toolkit behind teachers backs, since it can count as a crime. Get permission from the authorative personel (whether they be teachers, or bosses, or parents)

I mean, there's not really much to this project, but kinda wanted to outline the goals (and to give myself a moral compass)
